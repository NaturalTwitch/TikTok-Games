# Minecraft Interactor for TikTok Live

### Elevate Your TikTok Minecraft Streams with Viewer Interaction!

## Setup

1. Download the executable (.exe) file and run it once. The program will automatically close, creating a configuration file. Open the config file, where you'll be prompted to enter your TikTok username.

    ```ini
    [TikTok]
    username = your_username
    ```

2. Once set up, you can run the program whenever you go live. The TikTok username setting is a one-time process, and you can change it at your convenience.

   This module acts as both a keyboard and mouse. While there's no need to adjust your Minecraft keyboard settings, for mouse movement during gameplay, ensure you have:

    ```
    Options > Controls > Mouse Settings ... > Raw Input: OFF
    ```

    And that's all for the setup!

## Gift Interactions

As mentioned earlier, this module simulates keyboard and mouse actions corresponding to various TikTok gifts:

- **Shares:** Pushes the 'W' key for 2 seconds.
- **Roses:** Holds down the 'W' key for 5 seconds, plus the number of roses received (e.g., 5 roses = 5 extra seconds).
- **Tiktok:** Holds down the 'S' key for 5 seconds, plus the number of TikTok gifts.
- **Ice Cream Cone:** Holds down the 'A' key for 5 seconds, plus the number of Ice Cream Cones.
- **GG:** Holds down the 'D' key for 5 seconds, plus the number of GG gifts.
- **Finger Heart:** Holds the left-click for 2 seconds.
- **Fire:** Holds the right-click for 10 seconds.

## Non-Gifted Movements

- Typing 1-9 will select the corresponding item in the hotbar.
- Typing 'E' will toggle the 'E' key for the inventory.
- Typing Up, Down, Left, or Right will make the player look in those directions.
